This directory contains analysis of some Lariat data obtained by Jim Kowalkowski. The idea is to demonstrate the usefullness of ParaView for analysis. 

The main notebook "Lariat Track Movie" may be viewed in your browser at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lyon-fnal/publicAnalysis/blob/master/Paraview/Lariat/Lariat%20Track%20Movie.ipynb (you can also view it by navigating to that file in github, but the movies won't work. Use the link above to see the movies).
