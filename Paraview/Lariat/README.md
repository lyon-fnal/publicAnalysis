This directory contains analysis of some Lariat data obtained by Jim Kowalkowski. The idea is to demonstrate the usefullness of ParaView for analysis. 

There are two notebooks:

"Lariat Track Movie" shows track and hit information and may be viewed in your browser at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lyon-fnal/publicAnalysis/blob/master/Paraview/Lariat/Lariat%20Track%20Movie.ipynb?flush_cache=true (you can also view it by navigating to that file in github, but the movies won't work. Use the link above to see the movies).

"Lariat Waveform" shows wire waveform information. See http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lyon-fnal/publicAnalysis/blob/master/Paraview/Lariat/Lariat%20Waveforms.ipynb?flush_cache=true
